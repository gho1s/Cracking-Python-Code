The programs in Cracking Codes with Python implement and break various encryption algorithms, including Caesar cipher, 
Transposition cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, and RSA encryption. They showcase how to encrypt and decrypt messages, perform brute-force attacks,
use frequency analysis to crack codes, and automate cryptographic solutions. These projects are designed to teach cryptography and Python programming through hands-on examples.
